# Code Highlighter

Less than a minute, that's what it takes for a basic use of this code highlighter.

Pure JS, with support up to IE8(don't ask me why), highlighted scripts can be auto loaded by Ajax.

No css files to include, there are prebuilt color schemes.

You can [edit/add color schemes](www.github.com), and [edit/add keywords restrictions](www.github.com).

Include *code-highlighter.min.js* within your page, and then your code:

```html
<textarea data-syntax="markup" data-url="my/markup/location"></textarea>
```
